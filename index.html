        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          0xCastle is a 5-day program focused on blockchain education and
          research, set in a historic castle near Leipzig, Germany. A selected
          group of researchers, developers, and technical blockchain enthusiasts
          will convene post-ETHBerlin (May 26-31) to educate, research, and
          connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focused on pivotal blockchain issues in topics like privacy,
          scalability, and interoperability, the retreat integrates a mix of
          talks, workshops, and research groups. Tailored for knowledge sharing
          between participants, the schedule enables interdisciplinary
          brainstorming on current research questions.

      <!-- Motivation -->
      <article>
        <h2 id="background">1. Background</h2>
        <p>
          The 0xCastle team had a transformative experience at <a href="https://0xvillage.org">0xVillage</a> in Turkey that inspired us to pursue 0xCastle. We were deeply moved by the commitment to the blockchain ethos, not only in tech but also in the community's mindset. Every interaction echoed a shared vision of steering blockchain towards greater trustlessness, transparency, and privacy. It made us realize how those values are getting lost in the culture of web3, the applications built, and how we communicate with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralization must transcend beyond a marketing buzzword for websites and tweets. 0xCastle emerges as a response - a call to the technical community to embody and reinforce the principles of blockchain. Through a blend of peer-to-peer teaching, open dialogue, and collective problem-solving, we will navigate the forefront of blockchain innovation; steadily aligning our ideations with the core principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team, with its experience in organizing events like <a href="https://0xvillage.org">0xVillage</a>, <a href="https://www.tum-blockchain.com/conference">TUM Blockchain Conference</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qopGYx12K4">Ledgerfest</a>, and many more, is committed to fostering an authentic and impactful experience. Given these seeds, 0xCastle serves as more than a platform for education and research; it's a journey towards first-principle thinking in our work, connections, and inner selves.
        </p>

        The 0xCastle Research Retreat, unfolding over five days, welcomes a select group of tech-savvy blockchain enthusiasts from academia and industry. Participants will be immersed in a comprehensive program focused on learning, teaching, research, and connection. The carefully selected talks, workshops, and research sessions will be delivered from a vetted lineup of attendees, educational collaborators, speakers, and sponsors. Their difficulty spans from introductory talks to in-depth research discussions, covering topics like cryptography (ZK, MPC, FHE), layer 2 & rollups, disaggregated blockchain layers, mechanism design, and more, depending on expressed interest. This unique participant-driven approach ensures an interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and ideas, where each attendee not only absorbs knowledge but also contributes to the collective wisdom.
