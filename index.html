        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The 0xCastle Research Retreat is a collaborative platform emphasizing
          education and research on blockchain technology. Subsequent to ETH
          Berlin, approximately 50 researchers, developers, and blockchain
          enthusiasts will live in a historic castle near Leipzig, Germany, for
          a five-day program. There, we will offer an environment for in-depth
          learning and discussions on current technological advancements in
          privacy, scalability, and more. The retreat's framework, coupled with
          the diverse and historic castle environment, is designed to stimulate
          engaging brainstorming sessions among selected participants. Our
          sponsors allow us to reduce the room cost, serve food, and provide
          financial aid for students.

      <!-- Motivation -->
      <article>
        <h2 id="motivation">1. Background</h2>
        <p>
          In a world where blockchainâ€™s promise of decentralization becomes more
          a buzzword, the technical community is called to re-enforce our
          values. We need to reflect on the principles that allowed this space
          to emerge: a commitment to trustlessness and transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honoring the decentralized ethos of blockchain, the next generation of
          tech-savvy industry shapers should come together to ponder and
          overcome current obstacles in technological advancements. Therefore,
          0xCastle is more than an unconference; it's a collaborative platform
          for technical education and research. Selected participants will teach
          each other about most current technological advancements and
          brainstorm on them. It will always be considered how decentralized
          principles, a concept that we believe is fundamental to the future of
          societal advancement, can be improved within emerging tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          0xCastle is a collaborative project of academic event organizers. With
          past projects such as 0xVillage, TUM Blockchain Conference,
          Ledgerfest, Consensus student program, and different hackathons &
          hacker houses, the team is committed to creating the most authentic
          and meaningful experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to assembling a diverse group of the brightest, most
          tech-savvy individuals from both industry and academia. This
          confluence of minds is not just about bringing together experts, but
          about nurturing the rising stars who will shape the future of
          technology. To facilitate this, we have chosen extraordinary settings
          for our retreats, places that inspire unconventional thinking and
          creativity. Our mission is clear: to create an environment that is
          conducive to the free flow of ideas, where intellectual curiosity is
          nurtured, and innovative solutions to complex problems are born.
          Through this approach, we aim to not only contribute to the field of
          blockchain technology but also to foster a new generation of thinkers
          who are equipped to tackle the challenges of a rapidly evolving
          digital world.

        <h3 id="content">2.1 Content</h3>
        <p>
          The 0xCastle Research Retreat is a five-day program for selected
          tech-savvy applicants from academia and industry. Participants will
          learn, educate, research, and hack in a schedule that is curated to
          cover and advance pressing topics aligned with the interest and
          knowledge base of participants. With varying depth and intensity of
          different topics, there will be anything form introductory-based talks
          to educational series and research groups. Content will be presented
          by participants themselves based on their application and evaluated
          topic of expertise, invited speakers, and sponsors through
          presentations, workshops, and other activities.
        </p>

        <p>
          While a framework can provide many benefits for technological
          (Auseinandersetzungen), most ideas emerge from (ungewungene)
          discussions and exchange. Therefore, besides an educational program,
          the castle offers a space for connecting and brainstorming with each
          other through various group activities. There will be enough free time
          to engage with each other in wellness activities, games, cocktail
          hours, and more surprises to be discovered.
        </p>
        <h3 class="logistics">2.2 Logistics</h3>
        <p>
          As soon as Eth Berlin ends, a shuttle will bring the selected
          participants from Berlin to the Castle near Leipzig, where they will
          live for five days. Next to the prepared schedule, participants will
          enjoy three meals per day and have drinks and activities included in
          their ticket. Selected participants can choose between different room
          options of dorm, double room and single room, either with shared or
          private bathroom. Depending on the chosen package, the price varies
          between 70 EUR to 250 EUR per night. To create an accessible event, we
          offer financial aid for students, supported by our sponsors.

            With a limited capacity of about 50 participants, 0xCastle will host
            about 40% from academia and 60% from industry, although most
            industry professionals will have a strong academic background. All
            participants will have a technical background in, e.g., computer
            science, math, or a related topic, and are currently working on and
            researching cutting-edge technology in the blockchain space. These
            topics can be anything from, but not limited to, zero knowledge
            cryptography, modular blockchains, account abstraction, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            We invite anyone with such background to apply to this program to
            pursue education and research with peers. Potential participants
            working in academia or students are invited to apply for financial
            aid as well to waive their participation cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apply Now! Be as elaborate as possible in your application and show
            us that you have the mindset and knowledge to push this space

        <div class="section-text">
          <p>
            Due to the very limited spots we have available for speakers, coming
            as a speaker is on an invite-only basis. We will only invite
            speakers who will be able to add exceptional value to our program by
            educating participants in their demonstrated area of expertise, as
            well as pose and guide pressing research questions.

        <div class="section-text">
          <p>
            We believe that decentralization not only applies to the technology
            we use, but also to the education we create and research we pursue.
            Information should not be made available by only one source.
            Therefore, as an educational initiative, we have several non-profit
            partners that will support our educational content. Currently
            (umfassen) the TUM Blockchain Club and Blockchain Acceleration
            Foundation, any educational institution focussed on blockchain is
            welcome to contribute.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a blockchain club from a university or another non-profit
            educational initiative, we welcome your email for participation.
            Partners will get a few spots to achieve a collaborative environment
            of as many universities and institutions as possible. Members of
            those institutions are welcome to apply as participants and mention
            the interest of their initiative as well.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="section-title">4.4 Sponsors</h3>
        <div class="section-text">
          <p>
            While monetary support is much needed to make such an initiative
            possible, our selection process is thorough as any sponsor
            participating must add educational value to our program.
            Furthermore, no advertisement for specific ecosystems beyond brand
            placement will be allowed. This applies specifically to talks,
            workshops, and other presentations where the focus should be
            entirely on technical aspects.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to support the event with financial means to allow smart
            people to focus on research & education, we welcome your email. You
            will strongly contribute to educational freedom and allow students
            to come for free.
